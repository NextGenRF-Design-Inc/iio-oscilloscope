# NGRF IIO-Oscilloscope
This repo contains items necessary to run Analog Devices IIO-Oscilloscope on supported NextGenRF Design Hardware.  This includes the BytePipe_x9002 SOM shown below.

The IIO-Oscilloscope application developed by Analog Devices is a cross platform GUI application for capturing and plotting time domain, frequency domain, constellation, and cross-correlation data.  The application is designed to demonstrate the performance of Analog Devices evaluation boards.  This repository adds support for the BytePipe_x9002 SOM and other NextGenRF Design Hardware platforms.  The PC software can be downloaded from the releases tab [here](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-oscilloscope/releases).
